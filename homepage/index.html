                    Here I was a full-stack NodeJS developer maintaining a static front-end landing page in ReactJS, and writing API endpoints in ExpressJS.
                    I also setup and deployed the web application to Azure Web Apps (complete with a CD pipeline) with an Azure CosmosDB database and connections to Azure Functions for email sending!
                    I also helped with developing their desktop application in ElectronJS. 
                    The work was for a simple yet elegant IoT bluetooth device that had massive impact as it was used by children with severe disabilities, 
                    giving them the ability to be independent.

                    It was at this job I was introduced to Azure and the world of ServiceNow and PowerShell scripting!
                    My major project was developing for a massive automation on the ServiceNow platform that would ease the 
                    process of jobsite start-ups. This meant streamlining almost 100 workflow elements from automatic approval processeses and order forms 
                    to triggering automations running on Azure and on-premise servers of PCL to handle mundane data entry tasks.
                    There was plenty of work to do here, and it was also where I worked with and met some amazing friends!

                    My very first developer job! I worked on an in-house desktop data analyzer software written in C++, using Qt, Qwt and Boost.
                    Although the tech was old (I'm talking 10 years old - I had to update the dependencies one by one and at one point had over 1000 errors...), 
                    this internship holds a dear place in my heart. I was successful in reviving the technology, improving the UI, and developing a bunch of new features for it in 
                    just 4 months. It really helped with battling my imposter syndrome and letting me know that I chose the right career.
